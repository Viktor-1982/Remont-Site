# Preparing Walls for Painting

> Flawless, long-lasting paint starts before you even open the can — with proper **wall preparation**: covering, spackling, sanding, and priming.

Even the most expensive paint won't give you a smooth, durable finish if your walls aren't prepared.  
These simple steps will help you avoid mistakes and unnecessary costs.

## 1. Covering Floors and Furniture

Before starting work, cover the floor with a protective plastic sheet or heavy cloth. This will protect against stains.  
If you can't move furniture out — cover it with plastic and secure the covering with painter's tape.

💡 **Pro tip:** use construction tape with an attached plastic sheet already attached — it saves time and nerves.

## 2. Taping Corners and Baseboards

Painter's tape is essential for crisp paint lines. Use it to mask baseboards, trim, outlets, and light switches.

- The tape should be pressed down firmly, otherwise paint will bleed through.
- Remove the tape right after painting, while the paint is still slightly wet.

💡 **Pro tip:** choose quality tape — cheap options leave residue and tear easily.

## 3. Filling Cracks and Gaps with Spackle

All defects need to be filled with spackle: cracks, chips, and bumps.

1. Clean the crack of dust.
2. Fill it with spackle using a putty knife.
3. Remove excess and smooth the surface.
4. After it dries, lightly sand it.

💡 **Pro tip:** for deep cracks, apply several thin coats, otherwise the spackle will crack.

## 4. Sanding the Surface

Sanding removes bumps and remnants of old paint.

- Use fine-grit sandpaper (P120–P180) or sanding mesh.
- Work evenly, without heavy pressure.
- After sanding, remove dust with a damp sponge or vacuum.

💡 **Pro tip:** attach sandpaper to a sanding block or use an orbital sander — the result is faster and smoother.

## 5. Priming the Walls

Primer strengthens the base and improves paint adhesion.

1. Stir the primer.
2. Apply with a roller on large areas, use a brush in corners.
3. Let the coat dry (usually 4–6 hours).

💡 **Pro tip:** don't skimp on primer — it will reduce paint consumption and extend the life of the finish.

## 📐 Paint Calculator

Before moving on to painting, calculate how many gallons of paint you'll need for your room:

Example: room 16×10 ft, ceiling 9 ft, without large windows ≈ **6–7 gallons** of paint.

## ✅ Summary

Preparation takes longer than the painting itself, but it determines the quality of the result.  
Follow each step — and the paint will go on smooth, without drips or bubbles, and your walls will look great for many years.
