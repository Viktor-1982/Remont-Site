# Preparing walls for painting

Even the most expensive paint won’t give a smooth and long-lasting result if the walls are not prepared.  
These simple steps will help you avoid mistakes and extra costs.

## 1. Covering the floor and furniture

Before starting, protect the floor with a plastic sheet or thick fabric. This will save it from stains.  
If you can’t move the furniture — cover it with polyethylene and secure the sheet with masking tape.

💡 **Tip:** use construction tape with attached film — it saves time and nerves.

## 2. Taping corners and baseboards

Masking tape is essential for clean paint edges. Use it to cover baseboards, window frames, sockets, and switches.

- The tape should stick firmly, otherwise paint will leak.
- Remove the tape right after painting, while the paint is still slightly wet.

💡 **Tip:** choose quality tape — cheap ones leave marks and tear apart.

## 3. Filling cracks and seams with putty

All defects must be filled with putty: cracks, chips, uneven areas.

1. Clean the crack from dust.
2. Fill it with putty using a spatula.
3. Remove excess and smooth the surface.
4. After drying, sand lightly.

💡 **Tip:** for deep cracks, apply several thin layers — thick ones may crack.

## 4. Sanding the surface

Sanding removes unevenness and leftover coatings.

- Use fine-grit sandpaper (P120–P180) or sanding mesh.
- Work evenly, without too much pressure.
- After sanding, remove dust with a damp sponge or a vacuum cleaner.

💡 **Tip:** fix sandpaper on a sanding block or use a sander — faster and smoother results.

## 5. Priming the walls

Primer strengthens the surface and improves paint adhesion.

1. Stir the primer.
2. Apply with a roller over the entire surface, and a brush in the corners.
3. Let it dry (usually 4–6 hours).

💡 **Tip:** don’t skimp on primer — it reduces paint consumption and extends durability.

## 📐 Paint calculator

Before painting, calculate how many liters of paint you’ll need for the room:

Example: a 5×3 m room, 2.7 m height, without large windows = about **24 liters** of paint.

# ✅ Conclusion
Preparation takes more time than painting itself, but it determines the quality of the result.  
Follow these steps — and the paint will go on smoothly, without drips or bubbles, and the walls will look great for years.
