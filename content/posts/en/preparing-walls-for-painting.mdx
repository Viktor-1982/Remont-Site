# 🎨 Preparing Walls for Painting: Step-by-Step Guide

> A smooth, durable finish starts long before you open the paint can.  
Proper **wall preparation** — cleaning, filling, sanding, and priming — ensures that even budget paint will look professional and last for years.

Even the most expensive paint won’t give a flawless result if the surface isn’t ready.  
Follow these simple steps to avoid mistakes and extra costs.

## 1. Covering the Floor and Furniture

Before you start, protect the floor with a plastic sheet or thick fabric to prevent stains.  
If you can’t move furniture, cover it with polyethylene and secure it with masking tape.

💡 **Tip:** use construction tape with attached film — it saves both time and nerves.

## 2. Taping Corners and Baseboards

Masking tape is essential for clean paint edges. Cover baseboards, window frames, sockets, and switches.

- The tape must stick firmly — otherwise, paint will leak underneath.
- Remove the tape right after painting, while the paint is still slightly wet.

💡 **Tip:** choose quality tape — cheap ones tear apart and leave glue residue.

## 3. Filling Cracks and Seams with Putty

All surface defects — cracks, chips, or uneven areas — should be filled with putty.

1. Clean the crack from dust.
2. Fill with putty using a spatula.
3. Smooth the surface.
4. After drying, sand lightly.

💡 **Tip:** for deep cracks, apply several thin layers instead of one thick one — thick layers may crack later.

---

## 4. Sanding the Surface

Sanding removes roughness and leftover coatings.

- Use fine-grit sandpaper (P120–P180) or sanding mesh.
- Work evenly, without pressing too hard.
- After sanding, remove dust with a damp sponge or vacuum.

💡 **Tip:** fix sandpaper on a sanding block or use an electric sander — faster and smoother results.

---

## 5. Priming the Walls

Primer strengthens the surface and improves paint adhesion.

1. Stir the primer.
2. Apply with a roller across the wall; use a brush for corners.
3. Let it dry completely (4–6 hours).

💡 **Tip:** don’t skip primer — it saves paint and increases durability.

## 🧮 Paint Calculator

Before painting, calculate how much paint you’ll need:

<PaintCalculator />

Example: a 5×3 m room with 2.7 m height (no large windows) = **about 24 liters** of paint.

## ✅ Conclusion

Preparation often takes more time than painting itself — but it’s worth it.  
Follow these steps and your walls will look perfectly smooth, with paint that adheres evenly and lasts for years.
