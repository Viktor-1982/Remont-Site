# Painting Walls by Yourself

> Even the most expensive paint won't help if the walls aren't properly prepared.  
> But the right technique will give you a perfectly smooth and durable result — even without calling professionals.

## 1. Choosing Paint and Tools

![Choosing paint for walls and painting tools: roller, brushes, masking tape](/images/pokraska/paint_step1.png)

For living spaces, **water-based paints** are most commonly used:
- **Acrylic** — versatile and dries quickly,
- **Latex** — washable and durable,
- **Silicone** — elastic, hides microcracks.

Tools:
- wide and narrow rollers,
- brushes for corners and reveals,
- masking tape,
- plastic paint tray with ribbed section.

💡 **Pro tip:** roller with 8–12 mm nap length — for smooth walls, 12–18 mm — for textured walls.  
❌ **Mistake:** cheap roller leaves nap fibers, and without a narrow roller — corners will remain unpainted.

---

## 2. Mixing the Paint

Before starting, thoroughly mix the paint — pigments settle to the bottom.  
For 5L+ containers, better use a **drill mixer attachment**.

💡 **Pro advice:** periodically stir the paint while working.  
❌ **Mistake:** adding water "by eye" — this disrupts paint properties.

---

## 3. Painting Corners and Tight Spots

Start with a brush — roller won't reach corners and along baseboards.

**How to do it right:**
- use **flat or angled brush** 30–50 mm,
- dip the tip of the brush in paint, remove excess,
- work along masking tape smoothly, without pressure,
- work in 50–70 cm sections so the roller can overlap while wet.

💡 **Pro tip:** corners are better painted twice, in thin layers.  
❌ **Mistake:** painting corners with roller or removing tape after full dry.

## 4. Main Painting with Roller

Dip the roller in paint, roll on the ribbed part of the tray, and apply in a **"W" or "N" pattern**, then evenly roll from top to bottom.

**Tips:**
- work in 1–1.5 m² sections,
- edges should stay wet,
- first strokes — no pressure, last ones — light, "rolling".

💡 **Pro tip:** use extension handle for ceilings — less strain on arms.  
❌ **Mistake:** painting chaotically → patches and streaks.

---

## 5. Second Coat

First coat — base, second makes color richer.  
Wait **2–4 hours**, or check the label for exact drying time.

💡 **Advice:** apply second coat **perpendicular to the first** — this eliminates roller marks.  
❌ **Mistake:** starting second coat too early — paint will "peel".

---

## 6. Finishing and Cleanup

Final steps:
- remove tape while paint is slightly wet,
- wash tools with warm water,
- ventilate room without drafts.

💡 **Pro tip:** wrap roller in plastic wrap — won't dry out for a day.  
❌ **Mistake:** forgetting to remove tape → paint edge may tear or stretch.

##  Paint Calculator

Before painting, calculate how many liters you'll need:

<PaintCalculator />

Example: 5×3 m room, 2.7 m height, no large windows ≈ **24 liters** of paint.

##  Summary

Painting walls is not complicated, but requires care.  
Follow the steps, don't rush, and the result will look professional.  
Smooth color, clean lines, and neat corners — all possible to do yourself.
