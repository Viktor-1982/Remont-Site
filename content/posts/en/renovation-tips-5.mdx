![Renovation without chaos — Renohacks tips](/images/remont-sovety-5/remont-lifehacks.png)

> **TL;DR:** planning, +20% to budget, quality materials, room-by-room approach, and on-site quality checks — these five pillars will keep your renovation sane and stress-free.

Renovation rarely goes perfectly smoothly. But with a solid plan and common sense, you can preserve your nerves, money, and even relationships.

## 1. Start with a Plan (Otherwise Chaos is Guaranteed)

Renovation without a plan turns into a series of surprises: outlets end up in the wrong places, or furniture doesn't fit through doorways.  
Even a simple checklist with stages and materials will save you from chaos and shave weeks off your timeline.

## 2. Budget Always Exceeds Initial Estimates

However accurate your initial estimate, reality usually adds another 20% to it.  
The reasons vary: delivery fees, moving materials upstairs, additional tools, small issues you forgot about.

💡 **Pro tip:** build a buffer into your budget from the start. It's better to have money left over than to have to cut corners mid-project.

## 3. Materials Are the Foundation of the Result

Cheap paint or tile may look fine in the store, but in reality you often get streaks, chips, or color fading.  
Quality materials cost more initially, but they determine how long your finish will last and how your space will look.

💡 **Pro tip:** choose materials not just by price, but also by reviews from contractors and customers. Look at real photos after use.

## 4. Renovate Room by Room

Trying to redo the entire apartment at once turns your home into a construction site: noise, dust, and no normal living conditions.  
It's much wiser to renovate one room at a time — that way you can live in one part while the other is being renovated.

💡 **Pro tip:** start with the most critical zones (e.g., bathroom or kitchen), then move to the rest.

## 5. Check Quality as You Go

Errors made during construction are expensive and complicated to fix later.  
Regular on-site quality checks will prevent such surprises.

💡 **Pro tip:** check important details as work progresses, not just by eye after the work is done.

## Pre-Launch Checklist

- Work plan by stages and rooms
- Budget + **20% reserve**
- Material list + alternatives
- Delivery and contractor schedule
- Quality checkpoints: electrical, plumbing, geometry, seams, surface prep

---

## 💬 FAQ: Quick Answers

**How to calculate the reserve?**  
Take your estimate and multiply by 1.2 — that's your working ceiling.

**Which room to start with?**  
Usually the critical zones: **bathroom → kitchen → bedrooms/living room**.

**Where shouldn't you cut costs?**  
Wall prep, waterproofing, and quality paint — mistakes here come back quickly.
