# 🏠 Main Types of Wallpaper: Features, Pros, and Best Use

> Wallpaper is like clothing for your walls — it gives them texture, warmth, and character.  
Choosing the right one isn’t about following trends, it’s about understanding what will survive real life — kids, moisture, sunlight, and the occasional coffee splash.

Wallpaper has come a long way. What used to peel after one season can now last decades, resist humidity, and even be washed with a sponge.  
Let’s break down the **six most common types of wallpaper**, their quirks, and where they truly shine.

---

## 1. Paper Wallpaper

![Paper wallpaper](/images/wallpapers/paper.png)

Still the simplest and most natural option.  
Made from pure cellulose, available as **simplex** (one layer) or **duplex** (two layers) — breathable and eco-friendly.

**Pros:** light, affordable, and easy to apply.  
**Cons:** fades in sunlight, not washable, short lifespan.

> 💡 *Tip:* Perfect if you’re decorating a rental or want to change the look every few years.

*Best for:* bedrooms and living rooms where the walls aren’t touched too often.

---

## 2. Vinyl Wallpaper

Vinyl has a paper or non-woven base with a PVC top layer.  
It’s tough, washable, and comes in endless designs — from brick texture to silk gloss.

**Pros:** durable, easy to clean, hides small wall defects.  
**Cons:** traps moisture, not ideal for poorly ventilated rooms.

> 🧽 If you have kids or pets, go for *matte washable vinyl* — no glare, and fingerprints wipe off with a damp cloth.

*Best for:* kitchens, hallways, and family spaces with daily wear and tear.

---

## 3. Non-woven Wallpaper

![Non-woven wallpaper](/images/wallpapers/nonwoven.png)

A blend of natural and synthetic fibers pressed into a sturdy base.  
You don’t paste the wallpaper — you paste the wall.  
It doesn’t stretch, tear, or bubble.

**Pros:** strong, flexible, breathable, hides uneven walls.  
**Cons:** collects a bit of dust, slightly more expensive.

> 🎨 Can be painted several times — ideal for people who like to “refresh the mood” without removing old wallpaper.

*Best for:* new buildings or rooms with slight wall movement (cracks won’t show).

---

## 4. Fiberglass Wallpaper

Woven from fine glass threads, these wallpapers look tough — and they are.  
They’re always paintable and can survive almost anything.

**Pros:** fireproof, moisture-resistant, can be repainted up to ten times, lifespan 20–30 years.  
**Cons:** rough surface, needs special adhesive, pricier.

> 🔥 Great for commercial spaces or for homes with “active walls” — where chairs scrape and life happens. Cats can’t destroy them either.

*Best for:* corridors, offices, or long-term home renovations where durability matters.

---

## 5. Liquid Wallpaper

![Liquid wallpaper](/images/wallpapers/liquid.png)

This one’s applied like plaster.  
A mix of cellulose, cotton fibers, and glue that you spread with a trowel.  
It dries into a seamless textured surface — no joints, no waste.

**Pros:** hides cracks and uneven walls, no seams, easy to repair.  
**Cons:** not waterproof unless sealed with varnish, slow drying.

> 🪶 If your walls are crooked, this is your friend — it fills and masks everything without sanding dust.

*Best for:* bedrooms, living rooms, or creative accent walls.

---

## 6. Textile Wallpaper

![Textile wallpaper](/images/wallpapers/textile.png)

The most tactile and elegant of all.  
Linen, silk, or jute threads on a paper or non-woven base.  
They absorb sound and make any room instantly cozy.

**Pros:** warm texture, luxurious look, eco-friendly, good insulation.  
**Cons:** catches dust, absorbs odors, needs delicate cleaning.

> ✨ Works wonders in spaces where you want softness — a quiet office, a calm bedroom, or a hotel-style living room.

*Best for:* premium interiors and accent walls where beauty outweighs maintenance.

---

## ✅ Final Thoughts

Choosing wallpaper isn’t just about color — it’s about **how your walls feel to live with**.  
A family with toddlers and a dog needs something washable.  
A city apartment with uneven walls benefits from a forgiving texture.  
And a calm retreat might call for fabric that softens every sound.

> Pick the material that matches your lifestyle, not just your Pinterest board — and your walls will thank you for years.
