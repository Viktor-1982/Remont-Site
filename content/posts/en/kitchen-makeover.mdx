![Updated kitchen cabinets](/images/kitchen-makeover/fasady.png "Cabinets can be updated without full dismantling")

**1. Furniture film**
- Quickest fix: apply self-adhesive vinyl film (wood, stone, or matte finish).
- Easy to clean and looks realistic.

**2. Painting cabinet doors**
- Remove handles, sand, prime, and paint.
- Best option: **chalk paint** sealed with wax or varnish.
- Trending colors: olive green, dusty blue, beige.

**3. Replace only the fronts**
- IKEA and Leroy Merlin offer modular fronts that fit existing frames.

💡 *The countertop can be renewed with PVC marble-effect film or a new laminated board.*

## Lighting: The Secret Ingredient

**1. Under-cabinet LED strips**  
Add functionality and coziness. Powered via USB or adapter.

**2. Spotlights**  
Compact LEDs instead of bulky ceiling lamps.

**3. Warm light + reflections**  
Use 2700–3000K light for warmth; reflective surfaces visually expand the space.

## Backsplash: It Doesn't Have to Be Tile

![Peel-and-stick kitchen backsplash](/images/kitchen-makeover/fartuk.png "The backsplash can be renewed in one evening")

**1. Peel-and-stick panels**  
Stick directly over old tiles — subway, marble, or brick styles.  
Avoid placing behind the stove if not heat-resistant.

**2. PVC panels**  
Washable and easy to install in one evening.

**3. Tile over tile**  
For long-term upgrades — if the old tiles are well attached, glue new ones on top.

## Décor, Slats, and Cozy Touches

![Kitchen décor in a small space](/images/kitchen-makeover/dekor.png "Even a small kitchen can be cozy and stylish")

**1. Wooden slats or open shelves**  
Warm texture, extra storage, eco look.

**2. Minimalist handles**  
Black, bronze, or leather for instant modernity.

**3. Textiles**  
Linen Roman blinds or sheer curtains bring airiness.

**4. Plants and aroma diffusers**  
Greenery + scent = life and comfort, even if artificial.
