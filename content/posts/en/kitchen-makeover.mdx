## 🧭 Where to Start: The Cosmetic Makeover Plan

A **cosmetic makeover** isn’t about moving pipes or wiring. It’s about:  
— refreshing cabinet doors,  
— updating the backsplash,  
— repainting or covering walls,  
— adding décor and better lighting.

🔸 All this can be done **in 2–3 days** with your own hands.

## 🧱 Cabinets and Countertop: Paint, Replace, or Cover

![Updated kitchen cabinets](/images/kitchen-makeover/fasady.png "Cabinets can be updated without full dismantling")

**1. Furniture film**  
— The simplest option: cover cabinet fronts with self-adhesive vinyl.  
— Comes in wood, stone, or matte colors.  
— Easy to clean, looks realistic.

**2. Painting cabinet doors**  
— Remove handles, sand lightly, apply primer — and paint.  
— Best option: **chalk paint** with a finishing coat of wax or varnish.  
— Trendy colors: olive green, dusty blue, or warm beige.

**3. New IKEA or Leroy fronts**  
— If you want a long-term upgrade, replace only the doors and keep the existing drawers and hinges.

💡 *The countertop can be refreshed with PVC film that imitates marble or concrete, or replaced with a new laminated board.*

## 💡 Lighting: The Secret Ingredient

**1. Under-cabinet LED strip**  
— Adds comfort and functionality to your work zone.  
— Easy to install, powered via USB or adapter.

**2. Spotlights**  
— Replace bulky ceiling lamps with 2–3 compact LED spots for a modern look.

**3. Warm light + reflections**  
— Use warm white (2700–3000K) for a cozy feel.  
— Glossy tiles or metallic surfaces reflect light and make the space appear larger.

## 🧽 Backsplash: It Doesn’t Have to Be Tile

![Peel-and-stick kitchen backsplash](/images/kitchen-makeover/fartuk.png "The backsplash can be renewed in one evening")

**1. Peel-and-stick panels or tiles**  
— Stick directly over the old backsplash.  
— Comes in “subway,” marble, mosaic, or brick styles.  
— Avoid placing directly behind the stove if heat-resistance is low.

**2. PVC panels**  
— Quick, washable, and easy to replace.

**3. Real tile over old tile**  
— If you want a lasting result: small tiles can be glued directly over the old ones if they’re well-attached.

## 🪴 Décor, Slats, and Cozy Touches

![Kitchen décor in a small space](/images/kitchen-makeover/dekor.png "Even a small kitchen can be cozy and stylish")

**1. Wooden slats or open shelves**  
— Add warmth and natural texture.  
— Use thermo-treated wood or PVC slats with a wood pattern.

**2. Minimalist handles**  
— Black, bronze, or leather handles instantly modernize the look.

**3. Textiles and curtains**  
— Linen Roman blinds or sheer curtains brighten up the space.

**4. Aroma diffuser and plants**  
— Scents and greenery make the space feel alive. Even artificial plants can do the trick.
