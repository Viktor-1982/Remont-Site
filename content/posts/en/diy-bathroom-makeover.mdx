#  DIY Bathroom Makeover: Simple, Stylish, and Budget-Friendly

Sometimes just one look in the mirror is enough to realize: it’s time for a change. And the bathroom is the perfect place to start.  
Here’s a step-by-step guide to a **cosmetic renovation** you can do yourself — without major expenses or professional help.

---

##  Where to Start: Cosmetic vs. Major Renovation

Before buying paint and tiles, decide what type of renovation you really need:

- **Cosmetic renovation** — updating the look: painting, changing décor, laying new finishes over the old ones.
- **Major renovation** — replacing plumbing, leveling walls, or even remodeling the layout.

👉 In this article, we focus on **cosmetic renovation** — quick, affordable, and totally doable as a DIY project.

##  Planning Your Bathroom Makeover

**1. Evaluate the current state.**  
Check the walls, floor, and ceiling. Are there cracks, worn areas, or outdated finishes? Also pay attention to ventilation — mold and humidity require extra care.

**2. Break the process into steps.**  
Example:
- Surface preparation
- Tile painting
- PVC flooring installation
- Replacing fixtures
- Décor and finishing touches

**3. Choose your style.**
- Minimalism — clean and simple
- Scandinavian — bright and cozy
- Provence — pastel and romantic
- Loft — concrete, metal, and brick

**4. Make a list of tools and materials.**  
Paint, panels, adhesive, grout, brushes, level, respirator, gloves — all the essentials for the job.

##  Refreshing the Walls: Tile Paint, Decorative Plaster & PVC Panels

![Tile painting in the bathroom](/images/remont-vannoy/remont-vannaya-steny.png "Tile painting — a budget-friendly way to refresh walls")

You don’t need to remove old tiles — there are three easy ways to upgrade your bathroom walls:

**1. Tile painting**  
Perfect if the tiles are intact. Use acrylic or epoxy paint for wet areas and prime the surface first.  
💡 *Tip: matte finishes hide imperfections better than glossy ones.*

👉 A great option is **chalk paint** — it dries quickly, creates a deep matte effect, and adheres well even to glossy tiles.

🔄 *Sometimes you don’t even need to paint all the tiles: simply refreshing or recoloring the **grout lines** can make the whole bathroom look new.*

**2. Decorative plaster**  
Covers small defects and adds texture. Apply over tiles — requires some skill and creativity.  
⚠️ Best for dry areas, not in direct contact with water.

**3. PVC wall panels**  
Quick to install, durable, and available in finishes imitating stone, wood, or tile.  
✨ Modern panels with hidden locks create a seamless look.

###  Tile Painting Checklist

1. Clean tiles thoroughly.
2. Degrease the surface.
3. Lightly sand tiles with fine-grit paper.
4. Apply primer for wet areas.
5. Choose water-resistant paint (acrylic, epoxy, or chalk paint).
6. Apply 2–3 thin coats with drying time between layers.
7. Refresh or recolor grout lines if needed.
8. Seal with protective varnish or top coat.

💡 *Let the surface cure at least 48 hours before using the bathroom.*

##  Updating the Floor: PVC Tiles, Vinyl, or Paint

Three budget-friendly options:

- **PVC vinyl tiles** — click-lock or adhesive. Durable, waterproof, and easy to clean.
- **Sheet vinyl (linoleum)** — choose waterproof and non-slip versions.
- **Floor paint** — if the base is even, waterproof paint can provide a quick upgrade (though less durable long-term).

💡 *Tip: always check the level of the floor before installation — uneven areas will be noticeable.*

##  Décor & Cozy Touches: Slatted Panels, Fixtures, Plants & More

![Modern bathroom décor](/images/remont-vannoy/remont-vannaya-dekor.png "Accessories, greenery, and art prints for a cozy bathroom")

**1. Slatted bathtub screen**  
Assembled in an hour, stylish, and perfect for hiding cleaning supplies. Make it removable for easy access to plumbing.

**2. Matching fixtures & accessories**  
Matte black or bronze finishes are trendy and practical. Avoid cheap chrome — it fades quickly.

**3. Artificial greenery**  
Adds coziness without maintenance. Place it on shelves, near the tub, or in hanging planters.

**4. Posters & art prints**  
Yes, even in the bathroom! Just make sure they’re moisture-resistant or framed properly.

**5. Aroma diffusers**  
The final touch: choose scents that energize in the morning and relax at night (citrus, lavender, eucalyptus).

---

###  Slatted Bathtub Screen: Key Details

- **Materials:** pine, larch, thermo-wood, or PVC slats with wood texture.
- **Protection:** always seal wood with waterproof varnish, oil, or wax.
- **Construction:** make it removable or magnetic for access to pipes.
- **Ventilation:** leave 5–10 mm gaps between slats for airflow.
- **Style:** works well in Scandinavian, eco, or loft interiors. Use lighter wood in small bathrooms.
