# Transform Your Bathroom: Complete DIY Guide

Sometimes just one look in the mirror is enough to realize: it's time for a change.
And the bathroom is the perfect place to start.
Here's a step-by-step guide to a **cosmetic renovation** you can do yourself — without major expenses or professional help.

---

## Where to Start: Cosmetic vs. Major Renovation

Before buying paint and tiles, decide what type of renovation you really need:

- **Cosmetic renovation** — updating the look: painting, changing décor, laying new finishes over the old ones.
- **Major renovation** — replacing plumbing, leveling walls, or even remodeling the layout.

👉 In this article, we focus on **cosmetic renovation** — quick, affordable, and completely doable as a DIY project.

## Planning Your Bathroom Makeover

![Planning renovation](/images/remont-vannoy/planirovaniye.png "Planning is the key to success")

**1. Evaluate the current state.**
Check the walls, floor, and ceiling. Look for cracks, worn areas, outdated finishes. Pay attention to ventilation — mold and humidity need extra care.

**2. Break the process into steps.**
Example:
• Surface preparation
• Tile painting
• PVC flooring installation
• Replacing fixtures
• Décor and finishing touches

**3. Choose your style.**
Minimalism, Scandinavian, Provence, Loft — whatever makes the space feel like you.

**4. Make a list of tools and materials.**
Paint, panels, adhesive, grout, brushes, level, respirator, gloves — all the essentials.

## Refreshing the Walls: Tile Paint, Decorative Plaster & PVC Panels

You don't need to remove old tiles — there are three easy ways to upgrade your bathroom walls:

**1. Painting the tiles**
Perfect if the tiles are intact. Use special acrylic or epoxy tile paint designed for wet areas; always prime with a high-adhesion primer.
💡 *Matte finishes hide imperfections better than glossy ones.*

👉 **Specialty matte paints** (sometimes called "chalk-style" for their finish) are excellent — they dry fast, give a deep matte look, and adhere well to glossy surfaces. *Crucially, ensure the product is specifically labeled for use on tiles in wet areas.*

🔄 *Sometimes you don't even need full repainting — refreshing or recoloring **grout lines** alone can dramatically lift the whole bathroom.*

**2. Decorative plaster**
Covers defects and adds texture. Works over tiles but best for dry zones (e.g., the wall opposite the shower), not in direct contact with water.

**3. PVC wall panels**
Fast, durable, moisture-resistant. Modern panels with hidden locks create a seamless look.

### Tile Painting Checklist

1.  Clean tiles thoroughly with a degreaser.
2.  Lightly sand the surface with fine-grit sandpaper (e.g., 180-220 grit) to create a "key" for the primer.
3.  Wipe away all dust and apply a high-adhesion primer for wet areas and glossy surfaces.
4.  Choose a water-resistant paint specifically for tiles (acrylic, epoxy, or a specialized "chalk-finish" tile paint).
5.  Apply 2–3 thin coats with a roller or brush, allowing full drying time between coats as per instructions.
6.  Refresh grout lines with a grout pen if needed.
7.  Seal with 1-2 coats of a clear, waterproof protective topcoat or varnish.

💡 *Let the surface cure completely for at least 48-72 hours before exposing it to steam and water.*

## Updating the Floor: PVC Tiles, Vinyl, or Paint

Budget-friendly options:

- **PVC vinyl tiles** — click-lock or self-adhesive. 100% waterproof, durable, and easy to install.
- **Sheet vinyl (linoleum)** — choose a 100% waterproof, non-slip version with a thick wear layer.
- **Floor paint** — a quick refresh if the base is even and in good condition (less durable long term).

💡 *Always check the floor level — uneven spots will be visible and can affect the longevity of the new floor.*

## Décor & Cozy Touches: Slatted Panels, Fixtures, Plants & More

![Modern bathroom décor](/images/remont-vannoy/remont-vannaya-dekor.png "Accessories, greenery, and art prints for a cozy bathroom")

**1. Slatted bathtub screen**
Assembled in an hour, hides supplies, looks stylish. Make it removable or with an access panel for plumbing.

**2. Matching fixtures & accessories**
Matte black or bronze — trendy and practical; cheap chrome finishes tend to spot and fade quickly.

**3. Artificial greenery**
Adds a touch of coziness and requires zero maintenance.

**4. Posters & art prints**
Use only in moisture-protected frames or behind glass.

**5. Aroma diffusers**
Citrus, lavender, eucalyptus — set the mood and mask any damp smells.

### Slatted Bathtub Screen: Key Details

- **Materials:** pine, larch, thermo-wood, or PVC slats (PVC is the most moisture-resistant).
- **Protection:** treat wood with several coats of waterproof varnish, oil, or wax.
- **Construction:** design it to be removable or with a magnetic panel for easy access.
- **Ventilation:** maintain 5–10 mm gaps between slats for air circulation.
- **Style:** suits Scandinavian, eco, and loft interiors perfectly.
