# 5 tips for choosing colors in interior design

Color is one of the key elements of interior design. It influences not only the style of the room but also the mood of the people in it. To create a harmonious and cozy space, follow these 5 proven tips.

## 1. Consider the lighting

Warm light makes a space feel cozy and soft, while cool light refreshes and brings more energy. Before choosing a color, think about how the lighting in the room will interact with the paint on the walls and furniture.

## 2. Think about the atmosphere

Ask yourself: what feelings do you want to experience in this room? Calm, energy, joy, or focus? Colors directly affect emotions: blue calms, green balances, yellow energizes.

## 3. Use a neutral tone as the base

It’s best to use neutral shades as a foundation: beige, gray, white. They create a harmonious background that can be easily combined with other colors. Neutral walls and furniture allow you to change the mood with textiles and décor.

## 4. Test the paint

Before painting the entire room, apply paint samples on the walls in several spots. Observe how the color looks under different lighting — during the day and at night. This helps avoid unpleasant surprises.

## 5. Add accents

Use bright colors sparingly: decorative pillows, rugs, artwork, or vases. They bring life to the interior without overwhelming the space. The main rule is balance.
