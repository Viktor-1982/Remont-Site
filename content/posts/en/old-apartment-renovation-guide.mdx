# Old Apartment Renovation: Complete Guide — Where to Start and How to Avoid Mistakes

Renovating an apartment in an old building is not just updating the finish, but a **comprehensive engineering and construction project**. Such properties almost always have hidden defects, worn-out utilities, and layouts that don't match modern living scenarios.

Without a systematic approach, renovation can lead to budget overruns, delays, and technical problems after moving in. This guide provides a step-by-step breakdown to help you plan the renovation correctly and avoid critical mistakes.

## Features of Renovating Old Building Apartments

Before starting work, it's important to understand: apartments in buildings constructed decades ago require a fundamentally different approach than housing in new complexes.

### Worn-Out Utility Systems

Electrical wiring, plumbing, sewage, and ventilation in old buildings often don't meet modern safety and comfort requirements.

Common problems:
- aluminum wiring with limited load capacity;
- worn-out pipes and connections;
- weak or non-functional ventilation.

Replacing utility systems is a **basic and mandatory stage** of major renovation.

### Structural Limitations

Old buildings may have:
- uneven floors;
- partitions with low load-bearing capacity;
- limitations on allowable loads.

Not all walls can be demolished or moved. Using heavy materials (stone, concrete, solid wood) sometimes requires structural reinforcement and additional calculations.

### Insufficient Thermal and Sound Insulation

Thin walls, old windows, and lack of modern insulation solutions lead to:
- heat loss;
- poor sound insulation;
- increased operating costs.

These factors directly affect living comfort and should be considered at the design stage.

### Outdated Layout

Most common problems:
- small kitchens;
- narrow corridors;
- lack of storage systems;
- compact bathrooms.

Modern renovation is aimed not at cosmetics, but at **optimizing space for real-life scenarios**.

## Where to Start Renovating an Old Apartment

### 1. Technical Inspection

The first and most important step is an objective assessment of the apartment's condition. Check:
- electrical wiring and panel;
- water supply and sewage systems;
- ventilation ducts;
- floors, load-bearing and non-load-bearing walls.

This is when hidden defects are revealed that cannot be seen without opening up structures.

### 2. Budget Planning with Reserve

Renovating an old apartment almost always involves unforeseen work.  
Recommended reserve — **15–30% of the total estimate**.

Lack of financial buffer is one of the main reasons for deadline failures and project stoppages.

### 3. Determining Renovation Format

At the start, clearly define the scope of work:
- cosmetic renovation;
- major renovation;
- major renovation with replanning.

The renovation format directly affects timelines, budget, and need for approvals.

### 4. Design Project Development

A design project is not just visualization, but a technical tool. It allows you to:
- think through the layout;
- correctly place utility systems;
- reduce the number of reworks;
- accurately calculate material volumes.

## Main Stages of Old Apartment Renovation

### Demolition Work

Remove:
- old finishes;
- plumbing;
- utility systems;
- partitions (if allowed).

This stage often reveals additional problems requiring project adjustments.

### Replacing Utility Systems

A key stage on which safety and renovation durability depend:
- new electrical wiring;
- modern pipes and manifold systems;
- updated ventilation and climate control.

Saving on engineering almost always leads to costly consequences.

### Rough Work

Includes:
- leveling floors and walls;
- structural reinforcement if needed;
- screeds and new partitions.

### Replanning and Space Optimization

Most in-demand solutions:
- combining kitchen and living room;
- enlarging bathroom;
- organizing walk-in closets and built-in storage systems.

All changes must be made strictly within current building codes.

### Finish Work and Furnishing

Final stages that form the appearance and functionality of the interior:
- flooring;
- wall and ceiling finishes;
- door, lighting, and outlet installation;
- furniture and equipment placement.
