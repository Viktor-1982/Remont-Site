#  Bedroom Design: Comfort, Light and Inspiration

> The bedroom is the most personal space in any home.  
It’s where we rest, recover, and start our day.  
The goal of good design is to build calmness, comfort, and balance.

##  Natural Materials

Wood, linen, cotton, and ceramics bring warmth and texture.  
They “breathe,” soften the acoustics, and make the room feel more natural and alive.

##  Soft Light

Light should be warm and diffused.  
Wall sconces, floor lamps, and dimmable lighting help set the mood and comfort level.  
Avoid bright white light — it can make the interior look cold and sterile.

##  A Calm Palette

The 2025 trend leans toward neutral tones: sand, cream, terracotta, and olive.  
These shades create balance and relaxation, letting textures and lighting shine.  
Even a simple bedroom looks sophisticated when built on calm colors.

Inspiration often comes from contrast.  
Even raw materials — brick, metal, or concrete — can feel warm  
when paired with soft lighting, textiles, and gentle shapes.
