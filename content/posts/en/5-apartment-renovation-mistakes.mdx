> A quick, essential guide to help you spot trouble early.

## 1. Skipping the Detailed Project Plan

What goes wrong: rework, blown deadlines, and wasted money on undone finishes.  
Quick checklist:  
**layout → electrical/low-voltage → plumbing → leveling → rough floors and walls → finishing → doors/hardware → furniture → décor.**

## 2. Underestimating Budget and Hidden Costs

Always add **+10–20%** for unexpected work, debris removal, delivery, consumables, tools, and permits.  
Even "small stuff" like anchors, primer, and sealant adds up fast.

## 3. Overlooking Electrical and Plumbing Essentials

Separate power circuits, match cable gauges to load, and install RCDs/MCBs where required.  
Waterproof wet zones, leave revision hatches, and keep connections accessible — otherwise you'll be redoing tile in a month.

---

## 4. Choosing Materials Without Research

Where you can save vs. where you must not:
- **Can save on:** wallpaper, baseboards, handles.
- **Do not cut corners on:** leveling compounds, wiring, pipes, flooring in wet zones.

Always check **durability class**, moisture resistance, manufacturer warranty, and system compatibility.  
See our [renovation tips article](/en/posts/renovation-tips-5) for material selection advice.

## 5. Losing Control of Contractors and Timeline

No contract with milestones = instant chaos.  
You need a **timeline**, acceptance checklists, photo evidence of hidden work, and penalties for missed deadlines.
