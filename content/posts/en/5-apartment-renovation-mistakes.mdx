# 🚧 5 Apartment Renovation Mistakes Beginners Make

Before you start renovating your apartment, check these five traps that ruin budgets and timelines.  
A quick, essential guide to help you spot trouble early.

---

## 1. No clear project plan or work sequence

What goes wrong: rework, blown deadlines, and wasted money on undone finishes.  
Quick checklist:  
**layout → electrical/low-voltage → plumbing → leveling → rough floors and walls → finishing → doors/hardware → furniture → décor.**

See also our [renovation planning guide](/en/posts/renovation-planning-guide).

---

## 2. Underestimating the budget and hidden costs

Always add **+10–20%** for unexpected work, debris removal, delivery, consumables, tools, and permits.  
Even “small stuff” like anchors, primer, and sealant adds up fast.  
Learn more in [how to estimate renovation costs](/en/posts/renovation-estimates).

---

## 3. Ignoring electrical and plumbing fundamentals

Separate power circuits, match cable gauges to load, and install RCDs/MCBs where required.  
Waterproof wet zones, leave revision hatches, and keep connections accessible — otherwise you’ll be redoing tile in a month.

---

## 4. Picking the wrong materials

Where you can save vs. where you must not:
- **Can save on:** wallpaper, baseboards, handles.
- **Do not cut corners on:** leveling compounds, wiring, pipes, flooring in wet zones.

Always check **durability class**, moisture resistance, manufacturer warranty, and system compatibility.  
See our guide on [choosing reliable materials](/en/posts/materials-guide).

---

## 5. Weak control of contractors and deadlines

No contract with milestones = instant chaos.  
You need a **timeline**, acceptance checklists, photo evidence of hidden work, and penalties for missed deadlines.  
Learn how in our [contractor control guide](/en/posts/contractor-control).

## 🧾 Summary: Avoid Common Renovation Pitfalls

Renovation requires a system: plan → budget → supervision.  
Avoid these five mistakes and you’ll save **time, money, and nerves**.
