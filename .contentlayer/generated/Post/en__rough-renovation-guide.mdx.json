But no matter how different your plans and tastes are, the stages are roughly the same. The main goal is to go through them without losing your sanity — and ideally, with a bit of pride.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Preparation - think before you drill\n\nPreparation is the foundation of any renovation. Without it, the rest turns into an IKEA challenge without the manual.  \nMake a **personal plan**: where sockets will be, where the sofa will live, and where your sacred coffee machine will stand.  \nIf you’re planning **layout changes**, deal with them now, before your neighbors wonder why new cracks appeared on their wall.  \nAnd compare **prices and delivery terms** for materials — sometimes “saved money” and “spent a fortune” are just different stores.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Utilities - the invisible magic behind the walls\n\nThis is the stage where your place starts to look like a scene from a movie about electricians and plumbers.  \n**Electricity:** mark where the lights and switches will go — and where *not* to hang a shelf later.  \n**Plumbing:** pipes, drains, water outlets — boring now, but deeply appreciated later when nothing leaks.  \nDon’t skimp on professionals here. A one-centimeter mistake today can lead to liters of regret tomorrow.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Rough work - dusty, messy, essential\n\nLeveling ceilings, walls, and floors isn’t glamorous, but it’s the difference between calm nights and daily annoyance.  \nSkip this, and your wallpaper will develop artistic folds, while the wardrobe leans philosophically sideways.  \nYes, it’s dusty. Yes, it’s noisy. But your future comfort is being born in this chaos. Hang in there — beauty is coming.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Tiling - little squares of happiness\n\nBathroom, floors, kitchen backsplash — this is where civilization begins.  \nHere, precision matters: every millimeter counts.  \nDon’t be afraid of bold textures — wood-look or stone-look tiles have earned their place.  \nAnd if you’re laying tiles yourself, bring patience and a good level — both literally and spiritually.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Finishing prep - getting that perfect base\n\nPuttying, priming, light sanding — it’s basically a spa day for your walls.  \nDon’t rush this stage. Smooth surfaces mean smooth results.  \nEven expensive paint can’t hide sloppy prep.  \nWhen everything’s flawless, walls reflect the light — and your mood with it.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Flooring - walk proudly\n\nLaminate, parquet, vinyl, linoleum — the choice depends on budget, style, and cleaning habits.  \nDon’t forget the underlay: without it, your floor might sing ballads with every step.  \nAnd yes, heated floors in the kitchen and bathroom aren’t a luxury — they’re pure morning joy.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Bathroom - the temple of silence and reflection\n\nBathtub, shower, faucets, toilet — this is where genius renovation ideas are born.  \nCheck all connections and seals carefully.  \nIf nothing leaks and the water goes where it should, congratulations — you’ve reached plumbing nirvana.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Walls and ceiling - color your world\n\nPaint or wallpaper? Just not both, please.  \nPainting takes patience but rewards you with clean minimalism.  \nWallpaper adds warmth, especially with subtle textures.  \nA touch of color turns the place from “just an apartment” into *your* home.\n\n---\n\n## 9. The finale: doors,- baseboards, outlets, lighting\n\nThis is the glorious moment. The door closes softly, the switch clicks satisfyingly,  \nand the chandelier lights up your triumph.  \nBaseboards hide the last secrets of renovation, sockets await their gadgets — it’s the punctuation mark in your renovation novel.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Filling it with comfort - the best part\n\nFurniture, curtains, cushions, plants — everything that transforms “just renovated” into “home sweet home.”  \nThis is when you start smiling, even while looking at the bill for the sofa.  \nAdd some coffee aroma, a few framed photos — and yes, you’ve officially won the renovation war.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis is a universal roadmap for renovating an apartment with a rough finish.  \nSome stages may switch places, stretch in time, or disappear altogether — and that’s okay.  \nWith a bit of logic, patience, and humor, you’ll make it through.  \nRemember: a perfect home isn’t spotless — it’s simply a place where you feel **good**.\n\n---\n\n📸 *Photos: Renohacks.com collection*  \n🏷️ *Tags:* `renovation`, `rough finish`, `interior`, `finishing`, `plumbing`, `DIY`, `planning`\n",
