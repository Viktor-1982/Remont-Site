But with a solid plan and common sense, you can preserve your nerves, money, and even relationships.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Start with a Plan (Otherwise Chaos is Guaranteed)\n\nRenovation without a plan turns into a series of surprises: outlets end up in the wrong places, or furniture doesn't fit through doorways.  \nEven a simple checklist with stages and materials will save you from chaos and shave weeks off your timeline.\n\n![Renovation plan: checklist of stages, materials, electrical points](/images/remont-sovety-5/remont-plan.png)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Budget Always Exceeds Initial Estimates\n\nHowever accurate your initial estimate, reality usually adds another 20% to it.  \nThe reasons vary: delivery fees, moving materials upstairs, additional tools, small issues you forgot about.\n\n💡 **Pro tip:** build a buffer into your budget from the start. It's better to have money left over than to have to cut corners mid-project.\n\n![Renovation budget with 20% reserve: money and expense table](/images/remont-sovety-5/remont-budget.png)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Materials Are the Foundation of the Result\n\nCheap paint or tile may look fine in the store, but in reality you often get streaks, chips, or color fading.  \nQuality materials cost more initially, but they determine how long your finish will last and how your space will look.\n\n💡 **Pro tip:** choose materials not just by price, but also by reviews from contractors and customers. Look at real photos after use.\n\n![Choosing quality materials: paint, tile, and finish samples](/images/remont-sovety-5/remont-materials.png)\n\n---\n\n## 4. Renovate Room by Room\n\nTrying to redo the entire apartment at once turns your home into a construction site: noise, dust, and no normal living conditions.  \nIt's much wiser to renovate one room at a time — that way you can live in one part while the other is being renovated.\n\n💡 **Pro tip:** start with the most critical zones (e.g., bathroom or kitchen), then move to the rest.\n\n![Room-by-room renovation: one done, another in progress](/images/remont-sovety-5/remont-rooms.png)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Check Quality as You Go\n\nErrors made during construction are expensive and complicated to fix later.  \nRegular on-site quality checks will prevent such surprises.\n\n💡 **Pro tip:** check important details as work progresses, not just by eye after the work is done.\n\n![Quality check: using level to verify tile installation in bathroom](/images/remont-sovety-5/remont-check.png)\n\n---\n\n## Pre-Launch Checklist\n\n- Work plan by stages and rooms\n- Budget + **20% reserve**\n- Material list + alternatives\n- Delivery and contractor schedule\n- Quality checkpoints: electrical, plumbing, geometry, seams, surface prep\n\n---\n\n## 💬 FAQ: Quick Answers\n\n**How to calculate the reserve?**  \nTake your estimate and multiply by 1.2 — that's your working ceiling.\n\n**Which room to start with?**  \nUsually the critical zones: **bathroom → kitchen → bedrooms/living room**.\n\n**Where shouldn't you cut costs?**  \nWall prep, waterproofing, and quality paint — mistakes here come back quickly.\n\n---\n\n## 🏁 Bottom Line\n\nRenovation almost always involves dust and stress, but with the right approach it stops being a nightmare.  \nA clear plan, reasonable budget, reliable materials, and quality control turn the process into something predictable and successful.\n\n👉 Share your experience in the comments and check out the tag [#renovation](/en/tags/renovation).\n\n![Happy family enjoying their newly renovated apartment](/images/remont-sovety-5/remont-happy.png)\n\n---\n\n📸 *Photos: Renohacks.com collection*  \n🏷️ *Tags:* `renovation`, `lifestyle`, `interior`\n\n",
